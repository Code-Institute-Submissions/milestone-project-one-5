# Code Institute Milestone Project One

This is a postfolio style website for an up and coming local band, which will hopefully be used to replace the current experience at https://www.aperising.com/.

The new site can be experienced at https://huckcity.github.io/milestone-project-one/
 
## UX

The simple, dark design was used to be in keeping with the artwork for the recent debut album release, and somewhat in keeping with the retro theme of the music on said album.

## Features

The site is separated into 5 simple pages and titled according to the content of each page. I was limited in resources and information, taking only what was already available in the public domain, but would like to include more information prior to deployment.

### Existing Features

The site is based on Bootstrap and is responsive across all screen sizes. 

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [Bootstrap v3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to lay out components and bring consistent styling and responsive design.


## Testing

The site has been teseted thoghroughly across multiple screen sizes. This testing was conducted using Firefox/Chrome/Safari and each of their relevant developer tools.
The site has also been tested manually on the following devices
    -Macbook Pro 15"
    -iPad 4 9.7"
    -Xiaomi Air 13" (Ubuntu)
    -Honor Play 6.3"

The site displayed correctly in all cases.
